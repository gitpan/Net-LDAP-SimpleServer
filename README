NAME
    Net::LDAP::SimpleServer - Minimal-configuration, read-only LDAP server

VERSION
    version 0.0.14

SYNOPSIS
    WORK IN PROGRESS!! NOT READY TO USE YET!!

        package MyServer;

        use Net::LDAP::SimpleServer;

        # Or, specifying a Net::Server personality
        use Net::LDAP::SimpleServer 'PreFork';

        # using default configuration file
        my $server = Net::LDAP::SimpleServer->new();

        # passing a specific configuration file
        my $server = Net::LDAP::SimpleServer->new({
            conf_file => '/etc/ldapconfig.conf'
        });

        # passing configurations in a hash
        my $server = Net::LDAP::SimpleServer->new({
            port => 5000,
            ldap_data => '/path/to/data.ldif',
        });

        # make it spin
        $server->run();

    The default configuration file is:

        ${HOME}/.ldapsimpleserver/config

DESCRIPTION
    As the name suggests, this module aims to implement a simple LDAP
    server, using many components already available in CPAN. It can be used
    for prototyping and/or development purposes. This is NOT intended to be
    a production-grade server, altough some brave souls in small offices
    might use it as such.

    As of November 2010, the server will simply load a LDIF file and serve
    its contents through the LDAP protocol. Many operations are NOT
    available yet, notably writing into the directory tree, but we would
    like to implement that in a near future.

CONSTRUCTOR
    The constructors will follow the rules defined by Net::Server, but most
    notably we have the two forms below:

    new()
        Attempts to create a server by using the default configuration file,
        "${HOME}/.ldapsimpleserver/config".

    new( HASHREF )
        Attempts to create a server by using the options specified in a hash
        reference rather than reading them from a configuration file.

METHODS
    options()
        As specified in Net::Server, this method creates new options for
        the, server, namely:

            ldap_data - the LDIF data file used by LDIFStore

            root_dn - the administrator DN of the repository

            root_pw - the password for root_dn

    default_values()
        As specified in Net::Server, this method provides default values for
        a number of options. In Net::LDAP::SimpleServer, this method is
        defined as:

            sub default_values {
                return {
                    host         => '*',
                    port         => 389,
                    proto        => 'tcp',
                    root_dn      => 'cn=root',
                    root_pw      => 'ldappw',
                    syslog_ident => 'Net::LDAP::SimpleServer-'
                        . $Net::LDAP::SimpleServer::VERSION,
                    conf_file => DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE,
                };
            }

        Notice that we do set a default password for the "cn=root" DN. This
        allows for out-of-the-box testing, but make sure you change the
        password when putting this to production use.

    post_configure_hook()
        Method specified by Net::Server to validate the passed options

    process_request()
        Method specified by Net::Server to actually handle one connection.
        In this module it basically delegates the processing to
        Net::LDAP::SimpleServer::ProtocolHandler.

DIAGNOSTICS
    "Error message here, perhaps with %s placeholders"
        [Description of error here]

    "Another error message here"
        [Description of error here]

        [Et cetera, et cetera]

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    Net::LDAP::SimpleServer may use a configuration file to specify the
    server settings. If no file is specified and options are not passed in a
    hash, this module will look for a default configuration file named
    "${HOME}/.ldapsimpleserver/config".

        ldap_data /path/to/a/ldif/file.ldif
        #port 389
        #root_dn cn=root
        #root_pw somepassword
        #objectclass_req (true|false)
        #user_tree dc=some,dc=subtree,dc=com
        #user_id_attr uid
        #user_pw_attr password
